Hello!

To build the project in Android Studio, you need the latest version because I'm using Jetpack Compose! To get that go to: https://developer.android.com/studio/preview

Or you can just download the APK I created, install it on your device and run it from there: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHhD3I0SmkhGoapjgRpI1mU-w82taPTW/view?usp=sharing You will need a phone with debug mode enabled. 

There are comments scattered around the code base with links to material I used to help me code ðŸ˜Š. 

Let me know if you have any trouble building it: kes.walker@gmx.com
